# AI Agent Demo

We have seen a shift from conversational AI into Agentic AI, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of business automation. Our AI Agent Demo is designed to showcase the capabilities of AI Agents in a straightforward and easily digestible manner. 


## Background

Over the last 6 years we have been automating business processes with RPA tools both internally and across our client base. These were often Low Code platforms built specifically for orchestrating the automation of business processes across an organizations compute.

We employ incredible technologists, where we have often had discussions about RPA's shortcomings and how there was a much better world we could be living in. We believe in pushing the boundaries of the tools and platforms we utilize, and that is why we have drawn the conclusion below.

We believe that time is now. 

Generative AI has no doubt made an impact on our society. Since November 30th 2022, there has been a significant shift in the user experiences and capablities we are able to deploy into our technology stack. 

While initially it was great to be able to create a RAG app on your internal knowledge base, or provide a chat experience to your customers that felt more personalized, we have crossed into a broader set of use cases that will significantly shape organizations as we go forward.

Generative AI has evolved from conversational to autonomous. A concept of Agentic systems has emerged. While the definition is often vague as we are early in the journey it solves many of the shortcomings of traditional automation tools. 

We describe Agentic AI as a specialized program designed for ochestrating business process and procedures. This agent is trained on the specific procedure and given access to the tools required. 

Agents are capable of developing a plan, reasoning through that plan, and understanding when it needs a humans help.

While researching Agentic type frameworks we landed on Vercel's AI SDK through Modelfusion. We felt the user experience of writing code was the best at the time. We may be right or wrong and there are other great open source libraries solving this problem as well. (Langchain, CrewAI, more..)

What makes Agents so powerful is their ability to interact with applications across your tech stack utilizing API's. Tools in Agentic AI make all the difference in the world. The idea that you can give a team of agents acess to the tools required through API documentation, is truly transformative when it comes to business process automation.

Often these processes are spanning multiple systems, executing business logic, determining proper paths (fix), have a human in the loop concept, involve complex data analysis, etc.. Essentially all the things we as humans are able to quickly assess with our eyes and mind. This is where RPA has always fallen short. We are taking flexible business processes and saying it has to be either this or that.

When you can apply intelligence and reasoning to business processes and the ability to interact with other systems you cross into TRUE intelligent automation. This has been a concept thrown around a lot as a sales technique, however now it is real. 

We built the demo below to be an easily consumable example of an AI Agent. This demo hits many of the concept at a basic level that should provide the foundational understanding of what Agent AI systems are capable of.
